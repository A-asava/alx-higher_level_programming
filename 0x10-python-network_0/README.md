(Hypertext Transfer Protocol):

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is an application layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and is a protocol used for communication between web browsers and servers. Key features of HTTP include:

Client-Server Model: HTTP follows a client-server model where clients (web browsers) send requests to servers for resources, and servers respond with the requested resources or an appropriate error message.

Stateless Protocol: HTTP is stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server is independent. The server does not retain any information about past requests, and each request-response cycle is isolated.

Request-Response Cycle: A client initiates an HTTP request to a server, specifying a method (e.g., GET, POST) and a resource (e.g., a URL). The server processes the request and returns an HTTP response, which includes the requested resource or an error message.

Methods (Verbs):

GET: Retrieves data from the server. POST: Sends data to the server for processing. PUT: Updates a resource on the server. DELETE: Deletes a specified resource. Headers: HTTP messages include headers that provide additional information about the request or response. Headers include metadata such as content type, content length, and information about the client or server.

Status Codes: HTTP responses include status codes indicating the result of the request. Examples include 200 OK for a successful request, 404 Not Found for a missing resource, and 500 Internal Server Error for a server-side issue.

Persistent Connections: HTTP supports both persistent and non-persistent connections. Persistent connections allow multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection, reducing latency.

Secure HTTP (HTTPS): HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that adds a layer of encryption using SSL/TLS to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the client and server.
